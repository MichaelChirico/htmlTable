\title{Formats the p-values}
\usage{
txtPval(pvalues, lim.2dec = 10^-2, lim.sig = 10^-4, html = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{pvalues}{The p-values}

\item{lim.2dec}{The limit for showing two decimals. E.g.
the p-value may be 0.056 and we may want to keep the two decimals in order
to emphasize the proximity to the all-mighty 0.05 p-value and set this to
\eqn{10^-2}. This allows that a value of 0.0056 is rounded to 0.006 and this
makes intuitive sense as the 0.0056 level as this is well below
the 0.05 value and thus not as interesting to know the exact proximity to
0.05. \emph{Disclaimer:} The 0.05-limit is really silly and debated, unfortunately
it remains a standard and this package tries to adapt to the current standards in order
to limit publication associated issues.}

\item{lim.sig}{The significance limit for the less than sign, i.e. the '<'}

\item{html}{If the less than sign should be < or &lt;
as needed for html output.}

\item{...}{Currently only used for generating warnings of deprecated call
parameters.}
}

\description{
Gets formatted p-values. For instance
you often want 0.1234 to be 0.12 while also
having two values up until a limit,
i.e. 0.01234 should be 0.012 while
0.001234 should be 0.001. Furthermore you
want to have < 0.001 as it becomes ridiculous
to report anything below that value.
